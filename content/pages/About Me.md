Summary: This is an introduction to you knowing better



Hi i'm Kenneth Kinyanjui, my friends call me kenju254 but you can just call me Kenju.

I know C/C++ , Java, VB.NET and what i do all day everyday Python. I am both a Pythonista
and Djangonaut. By having those two titles, there are certinainly things you won't miss to
learn about such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, REST APIs, Heroku, caching , deployment, scaling, web
and generally a lot of backend stuff.

I do all my development on Linux (Ubuntu 12.10), and i am a supporter of open source.
You can find me in either of this:

1. [Github](http://github.com/kenju254)
2. [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/kenju254)
3. [Twitter](http://twiiter.com/kenmbugua)

I play basketball on a daily basis, and I am a HEAT fan. I also do competitive swimming and
I am in the University Swimming Team.

So much said and done, I think that is basically me.
